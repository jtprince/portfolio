> I've got a long list of things I appreciate about John so settle in. John is very thoughtful and disciplined about architecture and design. He listens carefully and clarifies the core elements of needs, stories, and context. John does an excellent job of guiding the creative process so that it appropriately explores options without getting lost in rat holes. He leads the team in converging on a great solution that each person has been able to influence and develop ownership in. John is also excellent at evaluating the performance of a solution and making appropriate optimizations, or in pivoting when required. In addition to working smart, John is one of the hardest workers I've had the privilege to work with. He is committed to doing things right including the interactions and long hours it takes to get there. John cares personally and has helped his team develop skills and confidence. He is a bridgebuilding as he works with other teams. I also admire John's courage to take risks and help the company move into uncharted strategic waters.

> John is a fantastic teammate and manager. He's always choosing the positive view, looking to improve the system, support his teammates, and meet the challenges of being a manager. He keeps our team on track and is able to always look for better ways to do things.

> John is a good team lead who lets team members present ideas and come up with solutions to problems. He doesn't micro manage and trusts the team to do the best that they can.

> John is well respected inside the organizaiton, clearly intelligent and a pleasure to interact with. I think he has very high expectations.
