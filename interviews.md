### Recapitulate the trier social stress test

> Technical interviews can also introduce other effects on candidates who report unexpectedly “bombing” [48], “freezing” [64], “choking” [57] during this critical hiring procedure. Through a happy accident, the software industry has seemingly reinvented a crude yet effective instrument for reliably introducing stress in subjects, which typically manifests as performance anxiety [75]. A technical interview has an uncanny resemblance to the trier social stress test [39], a procedure used for decades by psychologists and is the best known “gold standard” procedure [1] for the sole purpose of reliably inducing stress. The trier social stress test involves having a subject prepare and then deliver an interview-style presentation and perform mental arithmetic, all in front of an audience.  Alone, none of these actions consistently induce stress in a subject; however, the unique combination of cognitive-demanding tasks with a social-evaluative threat (essentially being watched) is consistent and powerful. If a technical interview is essentially a de facto version of a trier social stress test, then the implications can be profound. Rather than measuring the few that answer correctly in a timely manner, companies are most likely measuring the ability of the few who perform well under stress [30]. Rather than measuring explanation skills, companies are most likely measuring the ability of candidates to handle or mitigate stress (e.g. through practice [56]).

> a post-hoc analysis revealed that in the public setting, no women (𝑛 = 5) successfully solved their task; however, in the private setting, all women (𝑛 = 4) successfully solved their task—even providing the most optimal solution in two cases. This may suggest that asking an interview candidate to publicly solve a problem and think-aloud can degrade problem-solving ability.  

> Companies must decide at what cost they are willing to pay for verifying explanation skills in tandem with problem-solving ability, and what impact that has on their ability to hire diverse and talented candidates.

### Interview performance and job performance

> Years ago, we did a study to determine whether anyone at Google is particularly good at hiring. We looked at tens of thousands of interviews, and everyone who had done the interviews and what they scored the candidate, and how that person ultimately performed in their job. We found zero relationship.
