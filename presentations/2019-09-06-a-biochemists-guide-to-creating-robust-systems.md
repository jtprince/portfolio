People built open source tools and communities to solve their problems, to keep their freedoms, and to help others. 

[Right reasons]

Side effect: they built kick-ass systems.


Doing the right thing is likely to result in greatest ~~growth~~ / sustainability

## DRY

Don't repeat yourself

## DRY is the key to discovering your language's potential


## Isomorphism is the key to automation

    - DNA Replicase

## More functional > better programming

Avoid side-effects
Stop modifying your objects

## Immutability

Code like a functional programmer





Why `sorted` is usually better than `sort`

On estimates

    
Write code for humans, not the machine

If you are using indices in your loop in a higher level language, you are
probably doing it wrong.


Dumb messages, smart consumers (??)

Choose your ecosystem wisely and use it well
    * 
    * Use idioms

drafting coefficient

the world is a network
    choose the data structure to solve your problem

Software ~~Coding~~ Processes

Fail fast
    - tight feedback loops
    - short generation time

Your ecosystem/constraints determines your approach 

test the behavior you care about

use good tools

fewest lines of code

do not repeat yourself (DRY)

Open source what you can
