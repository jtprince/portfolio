One person's opinion


Do the right thing

For the right reasons

People built open source tools and communities to solve their problems, to keep their freedoms, and to help others. 

[Right reasons]

Side effect: they built kick-ass systems.


Doing the right thing is likely to result in greatest ~~growth~~ / sustainability

    synergy
    dynamic, scalable systems
    concurrency

## Isomorphism is the key to automation

    - DNA Replicase

## Replicating code allows for speciation!

    Potentially breaks isomorphism

## DRY

Don't repeat yourself

## DRY is the key to discovering your language's potential

## 95% of the problems you face have already been solved

Learn your standard library

## More functional > better programming

Avoid side-effects
Stop modifying your objects

Why `sorted` is usually better than `sort`

## Immutability

Code like a functional programmer

## Solve problems "late"

## 

On estimates

pay attention to how long you think a project will take, vs. how long it took

(2 to 3 times)

Why?


list.each_cons(2) { }.map

for i in list:
  list[i], list[i+1]
  if i 


    
Write code for humans, not the machine


If you are using indices in your loop in a higher level language, you are
probably doing it wrong.

## 

Dumb messages, smart consumers (??)



Choose your ecosystem wisely and use it well
    * 
    * Use idioms

## drafting coefficient

the world is a network
    choose the data structure to solve your problem

Software ~~Coding~~ Processes

Fail fast
    - tight feedback loops
    - short generation time

Your ecosystem/constraints determines your approach 

# test the behavior you care about

use good tools

## goal fewest lines of code

    Best code is code that you don't have to write or maintain

## Open source what you can

    github -
