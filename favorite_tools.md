# Favorite tools

I'm happy to use whatever tools are most appropriate for the job (including learning new ones), but these are my favorites at the moment.

### Languages

Ruby is my favorite language, but I also love working in Python.  I enjoy using R (better statistical abstractions), but Python solutions can be more easily integrated into full data analysis pipelines.

### Data Analysis

Some packages I've used extensively or have used a bit and hope to use more:

* The R package [lattice](https://www.statmethods.net/advgraphs/trellis.html) (trellis graphs to visualize high-dimensional data)
* D3.js (dynamic visualizations)
* gnuplot (and wrappers) (easily scriptable)
* matplotlib (beautiful plots)
* jupyter (analysis notebooks to encourage reproducibility)

### Coding

* [neovim](https://neovim.io/) - most widely used Vim rewrite (95% backwards compatible including vim packages but a clean rewrite)
* [neovim-gtk](https://github.com/daa84/neovim-gtk) -  GTK ui for neovim written in rust
* [pymode](https://github.com/python-mode/python-mode/wiki): rope, pylint, flake8, mccabe (code complexity analysis)
* [black](https://github.com/ambv/black) - uncompromising code formatter

### Commandline and source control

* zsh (using custom oh-my-zsh configuation)
* ack
* git + github

### OS and window manager

* [arch linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) - generally follows my personal philosophy on software.  Have performed ~100 installations.  [Current setup](https://www.dropbox.com/s/id63crm7pclojr8/INSTALLATION.txt?dl=0)
* [i3 tiling window manager](https://i3wm.org/) - an optimal solution for screen real estate management.
