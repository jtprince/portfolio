# Favorite tools

I'm happy to use whatever tools are most appropriate for the job (including learning new ones), but these are my favorites at the moment.

### Languages

* Python - great all-purpose language
* Ruby - more elegant than python but not as widely adopted
* Go - have written a little, translated some
* R - great for many statistical problems

### Data Analysis

Some packages I've used extensively or have used a bit and hope to use more:

* [lattice](https://www.statmethods.net/advgraphs/trellis.html) - trellis plots in R
* [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) - like lattice for python
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/3.2.0/gallery/index.html)
* [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) - dynamic visualizations
* [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) - analysis notebooks and interactive applications

### Coding

* [neovim](https://neovim.io/) - mostly compatible Vim rewrite
* [neovim-gtk](https://github.com/daa84/neovim-gtk) - GTK ui for neovim written in rust
* [coc](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) - use most of vscode in vim
* [black](https://github.com/ambv/black) - uncompromising code formatter

### Commandline and source control

* zsh (using custom [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) configuation)
* ack
* git + github / gitlab

### OS and window manager

* [arch linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) - follows my personal philosophy on software.  Have performed ~100 installations.
* [i3 tiling window manager](https://i3wm.org/) - an optimal solution for screen real estate management.
